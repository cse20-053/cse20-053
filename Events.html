                    <h2> The Bund </h2>
                    <p>After or during sunset is probably when you want to go and when it’s most magical when the dizzy array of lights take over the night sky.  Just be prepared to deal with the massive crowds that build up where eventually you’ll be shoulder to shoulder with other tourists and Chinese alike.</p>

                    <h2>Tian Zi Fang</h2>
                    <p> This is an arts and crafts neighbourhood that has developed from a renovated residential area in the French Concession area.  What I love about it are the maze-like alleyways that take you around to see a bunch of boutique gift shops, clothing stores, cafes, galleries, studios and other random knick-knack stores.</p>

                    <h2>Tourism Festival</h2>
                    <p>Most activities are closely related to sightseeing, dining, shopping, entertaining and exhibitions, fully showing visitors the irresistible charm of the city. Opening ceremonial grand parade, carnival and cruise ship parade across Huangpu River must highlight your Shanghai trip during this time.

                    <h2>Zhujiajiao/Qibao</h2>
                    <p>Many tourists come to China to experience what it would feel like to live during one of the Chinese dynasties.  A lot of times that consists of water ways, old crumbling buildings, alleyways, temples and street food.  Well you can have all of that by heading out to Zhujiajiao which is around an hour away from Shanghai.</p>

                    <h2>New year bell ringing</h2>
                    <p>On the last day of each year, many locals and even foreigners head to the Longhua Temple to take part in the New Year celebration: Bell Striking at 00:00. The bell is expected to strike for 108 times, which means dispel the misery of the old year and welcome good luck in the New Year. Apart from that, visitors can watch folk performances, guess the lantern riddles and make wishes before the prayer wall.
