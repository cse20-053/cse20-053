        <p> 1.Xiaolongbao or Soup Dumplings known to be a Shanghai Classic -These soup 
            dumplings should be your first meal in Shanghai. Delicate thin-skinned dumplings, 
            with pork or vegetable or shrimp or crab fillings inside with a delicious hot broth, 
            each is an explosion of flavor in the mouth. 
           <br> 2.Yellow Croaker Noodle Soup-Croaker is a popular fish in Shanghai, and so naturally the croaker 
            fish soup with noodles is one of the most local authentic dishes you can try. This fish grows 
            aplenty in the Yellow Sea and can be cooked in a variety of ways. It is easy to prepare and the meat is 
            tender and juicy. The broth is creamy and delicious, from hours of boiling fish bones.
           <br> 3.Fried Pork Buns-Pan-fried pork buns, a local fried dim sum dish of Shanghai, has a history of over 100 years. 
            The semi-fermented dough is fried in a wok, and water is sprayed on it several times during cooking. The fried bottom of this bun is absolutely yummy! 
            Best eaten hot, the bottom of a hot fried pan-fried bun is golden and crispy while the rest is white and soft. The stuffing,
            fresh meat with sesame or scallion, is especially delicious.

        <p>Villa compounds are virtually self sufficient entities. They are normally located near large parks and international schools, Villas are normally grouped 
           together in luxury living complexes that appear to be replicas of compound housing in Europe.
           <br>Traditional shanghai lane houses-In the old shanghai, local communities were built in a series of alleyways off major streets. These
           charming houses stand two to three storeys high and form long rows. It's a great way to observe shanghai life and interact with your neighbours.

        <p> Shanghai International Circuit has hosted a Grand Prix since 2004, with some memorable results. Lewis Hamilton has won it five times, Daniel Ricciardo won 
            it in 2018 and Michael Schumacher holds the track lap record. Formula One is probably the biggest foreign sports event of the year in China <br>
            The Diamond League, the pro track-and-field circuit, makes an annual stop in China every May at Shanghai Stadium. It’s one of only 14 events on the DL calendar, 
            so it has no trouble attracting a world class field. Around the world, the craze for marathons has abated a bit, but not so much in China, where it’s estimated 
            that there are around 1,000 marathons or half-marathons conducted every year.Shanghai’s most important contribution to this vale of pain and tears is in November, 
            the Shanghai Marathon, which begins on The Bund, obliterates traffic all over the city (but especially along the Huangpu River) and finishes near Shanghai Stadium. <br>
            If Formula 1 is simply too dé classé, there’s always Shanghai’s stop on the Longines Global Champion’s Tour Horse Jumping.

        <p> Pollution-The air quality in Shanghai can be appalling and can ruin your holiday, especially if you are sensitive to impurities in the air. If you suffer from asthma or 
            other allergies you should anticipate a worsening of your symptoms in Shanghai and may need to increase your medication. Eye drops can be a useful addition to your travel kit, 
            contact-lens wearers can experience discomfort here.<br>
            Medical & Dental Clinics-Shanghai is credited with the best medical facilities and most advanced medical knowledge in mainland China. The main foreign embassies keep lists of 
            the English-speaking doctors, dentists and hospitals that accept foreigners.<br>
            Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is extremely popular in Shanghai, both for prevention and cure. There are many Chinese medicine shops, but English is not widely spoken. 
            Chiropractic care, reflexology and acupuncture are popular, but check that disposable needles are used.
